Disclaimer: general advice from anecdotes across the industry

# Introduction

This is a collections of resources and tools I've collected from my journey into cyber.

# Advice for Beginners

## Networking

Talk to people, ask questions, find out what you want to do \
Find a mentor \
Join networking groups \
Build network on LinkedIn \
Reach out

### Learn to Communicate

There seems to be a focus on teaching cybersecurity professionals on how to write and communicate to non-technical audiences. \
Therefore, it would be valuable to learn and practice how to write and communicate professionally to others. \
Oftentimes, cybersecurity professionals will need to write briefings to all kinds of stakeholders, and therefore it is important that you can write a brief, tailored to diverse audiences.

## Practice and Showcase

### Virtual Machines

Every cybersecurity professional should understand and learn how to set up their own virtual machine. \
This is how we are able to safely analyse environments. \
Whilst mostly relevant to technical streams, it is something that all streams should have an understanding of.

### LinkedIn

Useful for showcasing your projects to potential employers.

### GitHub

Useful for showcasing your projects to potential employers.

## Professional Bodies

Join professional bodies for resources and networking opportunities. \

### Blue Team

## Education and Training

Lots of free programs out there

### Certifications

Certifications can be expensive so you need to consider if they are necessary. Anecdotally, I have heard that they are not necessarily the most important aspect of gaining a job - employers want to see evidence of your skills in the form of practical examples and experience. \
Furthermore, the types of certifications you get greatly depend on the role you are in, and therefore, be cautious before diving into a certification. \
Finally, if you're in a role, your employer may pay for you to get your certification.

### Bachelor and Postgrad Studies

Tend to take a more generalised approach to learning and does not provide detailed technical, practical knowledge.\
If you want to work in areas that are highly technical, Certificate IV or TAFE courses are probably going to be more helpful. \
Still looks good on a job application, as you can demonstrate that you have the ability to see things through to the end. \
Postgraduate studies are very expensive. \

### TAFE Courses

The most common is the Certificate IV in Cybersecurity. \
Sometimes these courses are offered for (nearly) free, if you are a local (if you try to do a TAFE course interstate, you will probably have to pay the full fee). You have to pay administration costs, but the course itself is subsidised.\
Fee-free courses are not available to international students.

### Keep up to date

Cybersecurity is constantly evolving, you need to keep on top of the latest news and technology through continuous self-study.

## Getting a Job

### Recruiters

### Practice and Demonstrate

### Entry level

Many professionals I spoke with started at in a different area to cyber (e.g. helpdesk or finance), then pivoted into cyber from within the same organisation. \
There are entry level roles, such as the CyberCX Academy. These are very competitive.

### Career Changers

There are many career changers in cybersecurity. Many cybersecurity organisations actively seek employees of diverse backgrounds. \
So don't think that you have no skills to bring to the table.\

### Women in Cybersecurity

Women are still a minority, although that it slowly changing.\

### Neurodiversity in Cybersecurity

Anecdotally, I've found that there are many neurodiverse individuals in the industry - which is amazing! \
The work seems well suited to

### Major hiring companies

Banks - pentesters \
CyberCX \
DxC \
CBA \
ASD \
Crowdstrike - remote first! \
EY \
Paraflare \
Lots of opportunity in Canberra. \
