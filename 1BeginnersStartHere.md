# Advice for Beginners

## Networking

Find a mentor \
Join networking groups \
Build network on LinkedIn \
Reach out

### Learn to Communicate

There seems to be a focus on teaching cybersecurity professionals on how to write and communicate to non-technical audiences. \
Therefore, it would be valuable to learn and practice how to write and communicate professionally to others. \
Oftentimes, cybersecurity professionals will need to write briefings to all kinds of stakeholders, and therefore it is important that you can write a brief, tailored to diverse audiences. \

## Practice and Showcase

### Virtual Machines

Every cybersecurity professional should understand and learn how to set up their own virtual machine. \
This is how we are able to safely analyse environments. \
Whilst mostly relevant to technical streams, it is something that all streams should understand.

## LinkedIn

### GitHub

### Certifications

Certifications can be expensive so you need to consider if they are necessary. Anecdotally, I have heard that they are not necessarily the most important aspect of gaining a job - employers want to see evidence of your skills in the form of practical examples and experience. \
Furthermore, the types of certifications you get greatly depend on the role you are in, and therefore, be cautious before diving into a certification.

### Bachelor and Postgrad Studies

Tend to take a more generalised approach to learning and does not provide detailed technical, practical knowledge.\
If you want to work in areas that are highly technical, Certificate IV or TAFE courses are probably going to be more helpful. \
Still looks good on a job application, as you can demonstrate that you have the ability to see things through to the end. \

### TAFE Courses

The most common is the Certificate IV in Cybersecurity. \
Sometimes these courses are offered for (nearly) free, if you are a local (if you try to do a TAFE course interstate, you will probably have to pay the full fee). You have to pay administration costs, but the course itself is subsidised.\
Fee-free courses are not available to international students.
