Disclaimer: general advice from anecdotes gathered from professionals across the industry. Please consider your own situation and make judgments as to whether the following advice applies to you.

# Introduction

This is mainly a collection of resources and tools I've collected from my journey into cyber. \
The contents of this specific page is information I wish I had known sooner, and therefore want to share with others so you don't make the same bad decisions I did - ha!

# Advice for Beginners

The following are areas that are important when you're starting out.

## Networking

I am an introvert and networking can be nightmarish - the thought of attending a 'networking event' gives me loads of anxiety! Therefore, one-on-one chats are probably the way to go. \
Here's what I did:

- Find a mentor (or several).
- Arrange to chat with people over coffee, ask them questions about what they do.
- Join networking groups - they usually have a mentorship program. If you're a student you can get a discount on fees.
- Connect with professionals on LinkedIn and start a conversation. Go for coffee.
- Remember that others are probably feeling the same way you are, if you end up at a networking event, perhaps look for another terrified, quiet person.

All the cybersecurity professionals I've met so far have been keen to share their experiences and offer advice. Don't be afraid of them.

## Learn to Communicate

I noticed that there seems to be a focus on writing and communicating to non-technical audiences. \
Therefore, it is probably valuable to learn and practice how to write and communicate professionally to others. \
Oftentimes, cybersecurity professionals will need to write briefings to all kinds of stakeholders, and therefore it is important that you can write a brief, tailored to diverse audiences.

## Practice and Showcase

Practicing the skills you've learnt is important, and if you can demonstrate it, even better! \
This seems to be as (if not more) important as having formal education or training. \
Here's what I did:

- set up my own segmented home network and firewall rules
- used GitHub to publicly share projects
- shared ideas and lessons learnt on LinkedIn
- write ups and walkthroughs of different TryHackMe rooms
- set up my own workspace for carrying out practice tasks on a virtual machine using Kali Linux OS

#### A bit more on virtual machines...

You should understand and learn how to set up your own virtual machine; this is how we are able to safely analyse compromised environments. \

## Professional Bodies

Join professional bodies for resources and networking opportunities. \
Refer to the Professional Networking Bodies Page for further detail.

## General Overview of Cybersecurity Roles

### Governance, Risk and Compliance

### Red Team

### Blue Team

### DFIR

## Education and Training

There a many free training programs out there. If you are just starting out, then look for these first. \
While it's not always compulsory to have tertiary studies, it can certainly help. It is important, however, to factor in a number of things when choosing between the two. \

### Certifications

Certifications can be expensive so you need to consider if they are necessary. \
Anecdotally, I've heard they're not necessarily the most important aspect of gaining a job - employers want to see evidence of your skills in the form of practical examples and experience. \
Furthermore, the types of certifications you get greatly depend on the role you're in, and therefore, be cautious before diving into a specific certification. \
If you gain a role, then your employer may pay for you to get relevant certification. Paying for it beforehand yourself doesn't make economical sense.

### Bachelor and Postgrad Studies

Tend to take a more generalised approach to learning and does not provide detailed technical, practical knowledge.\
If you want to work in areas that are highly technical, Certificate IV or TAFE courses are probably going to be more helpful. \
Still looks good on a job application, as you can demonstrate that you have the ability to see things through to the end. \
Postgraduate studies are extremely expensive - but you get access to graduate recruitment programs. \

### TAFE Courses

The most common course offered is the Certificate IV in Cybersecurity. \
These courses offer more technical, practical and hands on learning. If you want to enter a more technical stream (i.e. red or blue team), then this course may be for you. \
Sometimes these courses are offered for (nearly) free, if you are a state-local. You have to pay administration costs, but the course itself is subsidised.\
If you try to do a TAFE course from an interstate institution, you will probably have to pay the full fee which can be over $10,000. \
Fee-free courses are not available to international students.

### Keep up to date

Cybersecurity is constantly evolving, you need to keep on top of the latest news and technology through continuous self-study.

## Getting a Job

### Recruiters

### Practice and Demonstrate

I keep talking about practice, but I think it does need some emphasis. Without practice and demonstration, potential employers aren't going to know your skills.\
So practice, practice, practice.

### Entry level

Many professionals I spoke with started at in a different area to cyber (e.g. helpdesk or finance), then pivoted into cyber from within the same organisation. \
There are entry level roles, such as the CyberCX Academy. These are very competitive.

### Career Changers

There are many career changers in cybersecurity. Many cybersecurity organisations actively seek employees of diverse backgrounds. \
So don't think that you have no skills to bring to the table.\

### Women in Cybersecurity

Women are still a minority, although that it slowly changing.\

### Neurodiversity in Cybersecurity

Anecdotally, I've found that there are many neurodiverse individuals in the industry - which is amazing! \
The work seems well suited to

### Major hiring companies

The main companies found during my research are:

- The major banks - always seeking pentesters (no surprise there).
- CyberCX - have the CyberCX Academy, but this is very competitive. I've heard that CyberCX have a great and supportive culture for newbies though, so worth trying.
- DxC Technologies.
- Australian Signals Directorate / Defence - have regular graduate programs, but can be difficult to navigate the recruitment process.
- Crowdstrike - remote first culture, so this is no good if you prefer to be in the office. They also do not offer a lot of 'entry level' roles.
- The Big 4 Accounting Firms
- Paraflare

Finally, due to most of the Federal Government Bodies residing in Canberra, there are many, many opportunities there. \

It is disappointing that there are not more programs like the CyberCX Academy. There is a shortage in cyber skills, yet no organisations appear to be investing in future generations of cyber professionals.
