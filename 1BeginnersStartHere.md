Disclaimer: general advice from anecdotes gathered from professionals across the industry. Please consider your own situation and make judgments as to whether the following advice applies to you.

# Introduction

This is mainly a collection of resources and tools I've collected from my journey into cyber. I wanted to put something together that is fairly general but comprehensive to provide a direction for newbies - because when I started, it was so hard to figure out where to begin. Thank goodness for mentors! \
\
The contents of this specific page is information I wish I had known sooner, and therefore want to share with others so you don't make the same bad decisions I did - ha! \
\
The following are areas that are important when you're starting out.

## Networking

This is probably the most important part of trying to get into cyber. Having a network can help you find a job, understand the different roles there are, give key insights into the industry and provide you with support and some new friends! \
I am an introvert and networking can be nightmarish - the thought of attending a 'networking event' gives me loads of anxiety! Therefore, one-on-one chats are probably the way to go if you're also an introvert. \
\
Here's what I did:

- Find a mentor (or several).
- Arrange to chat with people over coffee, ask them questions about what they do.
- Join networking groups - they usually have a mentorship program. If you're a student you can get a discount on fees.
- Connect with professionals on LinkedIn and start a conversation. Go for coffee.
- Remember that others are probably feeling the same way you are, if you end up at a networking event, perhaps look for another terrified, quiet person.

All the cybersecurity professionals I've met so far have been keen to share their experiences and offer advice. Don't be afraid of them.

## Learn to Communicate

I noticed that there seems to be a focus on writing and communicating to non-technical audiences. Therefore, it is probably valuable to learn and practice how to write and communicate professionally to others. Oftentimes, cybersecurity professionals will need to write briefings to all kinds of stakeholders, and therefore it is important that you can write a brief, tailored to diverse audiences. \
\
Here's what I did:

- practice writing cover letters.
- write assignments and put effort into writing them clearly and in non-technical language (unless otherwise requested) with proper grammar and spelling.
- when doing projects and self study, practice writing out a walkthrough or a report on the new knowledge. This will also solidify it.
- avoid using AI to write everything for you - it's tempting but I found it often misses key points or is outright wrong. If you must use it, make sure you read what it has written and then try to reword it.

## Practice and Showcase

Practicing the skills you've learnt is important, and if you can demonstrate it, even better! \
This seems to be as (if not more) important as having formal education or training. \
Here's what I did:

- investigated technologies and practised using them
- used GitHub to publicly share projects
- shared ideas and lessons learnt on LinkedIn
- write ups and walkthroughs of hackathons / capture the flag events
- set up my own workspace for carrying out practical tasks on a virtual machine using Kali Linux OS

**_A bit more on virtual machines..._**

<em>You should understand and learn how to set up your own virtual machine; this is how we are able to safely analyse potentially compromised environments.</em>

## Professional Bodies

Make sure you join professional bodies for resources and networking and training opportunities, including mentorship programs. Local ones are best if you want access to local events and training. Refer to the Professional Networking Bodies Page for further detail.

### Blue Team

### DFIR

## Education and Training

There a many free training programs out there. If you are just starting out, then look for these first. \
While it's not always compulsory to have tertiary studies, it can certainly help. It is important, however, to factor in a number of things when choosing between the two if you don't want to waste time and money.

### Certifications

Certifications can be expensive so you need to consider if they are necessary. \
Anecdotally, I've heard they're not the most important aspect of gaining a job - employers want to see evidence of your skills in the form of practical examples and experience. \
Furthermore, the certifications you may need may depend on the role you want, and therefore, be cautious before diving into a specific certification. \
If you gain a role, then your employer may pay for you to get certifications. Paying for it yourself beforehand doesn't make economical sense.

### Bachelor and Postgrad Studies

These are very formal and tend to take a more generalised approach to learning and does not provide detailed technical, practical knowledge.\
They can take a long time also. \
If you want to work in areas that are highly technical, Certificate IV or TAFE courses are probably going to be more helpful. \
They still look good on a job application because it demonstrates tenacity; you can finish what you started. \
Postgraduate studies are extremely expensive - but you get access to graduate recruitment programs upon completion. \
\
The main ones are:

- Bachelor Degree (3-6 years average).
- Graduate Certificate (1-2 years average). Courses can count toward a masters.
- Masters (1-2 years average). Courses can count toward a PhD.
- PhD (3 years average).

### TAFE Courses

The most common course offered is the Certificate IV in Cybersecurity. There is also a Certificate III (lower level) or Diploma (higher level). Again, these can take 1-3 years, depending on a number of factors (part time, full time etc). \
These courses offer more technical, practical and hands on learning. If you want to enter a more technical stream (i.e. red or blue team), then these courses may be for you. \
Sometimes these courses are offered for (nearly) free, if you are a state-local. You have to pay administration costs, but the course itself is subsidised.\
If you try to do a TAFE course from an interstate institution, you will probably have to pay the full fee which can be over $10,000. \
Fee-free courses are not available to international students.

### Keep up to date

Cybersecurity is constantly evolving, you need to keep on top of the latest updates, news and technology through continuous and motivated self-study. If this is does not sound like you, then I have some bad news; cybersecurity is not for you.

## Getting a Job

This has been the hardest part and these are my findings so far.

Firstly, due to most of Australian Federal Government Bodies residing in Canberra, there are many, many opportunities there. If you're willing to move to and live in Canberra - perhaps consider this. \
\
I found that there are minimal entry level roles available, and it is disappointing that there are not more programs like the CyberCX Academy. Purportedly, there is a shortage in cyber skills, yet no organisations appear to be investing in future generations of cyber professionals. This makes entry level roles highly competitive and you will need to really stand out on your job application.

### Recruiters

You may opt to find a recruiter. I have not had much luck in this space, but worth giving it a go. I have not done much research on it yet, but perhaps if I get more desperate, I'll add some suggestions here.

### Practice and Demonstrate

There has been a lot of mention about practice! Without practice and demonstration, potential employers aren't going to know your skills.\
\
**_So practice, practice, practice._**

### Entry pathways

Many professionals I spoke with started out in a different area to cyber (e.g. helpdesk or finance), then pivoted into cyber from within the same organisation. This may be a good entry point, because you can leverage the reputation you have built with stakeholders and clients. \
\
There are also entry level programs, such as the CyberCX Academy which I mentioned previously, and graduate programs available to students completing a degree or higher.\
\
Some organisations will ask TAFE teachers to recommend their top students. Therefore, if you're doing TAFE courses, perform your best and maybe it will result in a recommendation.\
\
And finally, the most obvious is the old help desk / IT support. I've been hesitant to do this and it's not because I'm not willing to do that type of work, but most people know that it is not the most rewarding and, to me, it really feels like a drastic step backward from my previous career. I will try other avenues first, but I'm not discounting it completely.

### Career Changers

There are many career changers in cybersecurity. Many cybersecurity organisations actively seek employees of diverse backgrounds because it fosters good decision making and the ability to understand diverse viewpoints (particularly helpful if you want to understand an adversary). \
\
**_So don't think that you don't have skills to bring to the table. You are not starting from square one._**

### Gender Diversity

Women are still a minority, although that is slowly changing.\
Many organisations have managed to find a balance in gender diversity, however I have heard stories of 'being the only woman in the room'.
Many organisations are still working on gender diversity. The good news for women is that you are sought after! \

### Neurodiversity

Anecdotally, I've found that there are many neurodiverse individuals in the industry - which is amazing! The work seems well suited to the neurodiverse mind.\
\
My thoughts (are generalised and obviously do not apply to everyone):

- can analyse and hyperfocus
- can provide innovative insights
- like to investigate and delve deep into data
- like to get technical
- can work from home well and can work independently

### Major hiring companies

The main companies found during my research are:

- The major banks - always seeking pentesters (no surprises there).
- CyberCX - have the CyberCX Academy, but this is very competitive. I've heard that CyberCX have a great and supportive culture for newbies though, so worth trying.
- DxC Technologies - apparently have a neurodiversity program but I haven't been able to figure out when it opens or how to apply.
- Australian Signals Directorate / Defence - have regular graduate programs, but can be difficult to navigate the recruitment process.
- Crowdstrike - remote first culture - no good if you prefer to be in the office. They also do not offer a lot of 'entry level' roles.
- The Big 4 Accounting Firms
- Paraflare

If you feel that you are just waving about in the breeze (applying for roles), one piece of advice I was given is to focus on a couple of companies you are interested in, network with people from within the organisation and ask questions, i.e. how you can stand out in an application.
