# Certifications

Typically, people who start their certification journey will continue their higher level-certifications with the same organisation. Just something to consider when you decide.

Here's a roadmap of certifications and their relevant areas:

## Certificate IV in Cybersecurity

This may also get you access to LinkedIn Learning resources. \
Look for your local provider. \

## Bachelor, Graduate Certificate and Masters of Cybersecurity

This may also get you access to LinkedIn Learning resources. \
You can also get discounts to TryHackMe. \
Many online options available. \

## LinkedIn Learning

## Vendor-specific

I've been warned about vendor certifications and training because you may get 'locked' in to using a specific type of product. If you decide to get vendor training, try to remember the principles, rather than memorising the product itself. This way you can apply your knowledge across multiple platforms. \
\
Microsoft \
Splunk \
RedHat \
CISCO
