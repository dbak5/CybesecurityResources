# Certifications

Typically, people who start their certification journey will continue their higher level-certifications with the same organisation. Just something to consider when you decide.

[Here's](https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/) a roadmap of certifications and their relevant areas.

- [CompTIA](https://www.comptia.org/) **_[beginner friendly]_**
  - [Professor Messor](https://www.professormesser.com/) is an excellent resource for CompTIA studies; free and paid options available.
  - Many opt to go for A+, Network+ and Security+.
  - Alternatively, you can pay for the proper materials from CompTIA.
  - There is also a subreddit with many tips, tricks and advice.
  - Not as pricey as some other certifications, but not considered a 'high-level' certification.
- [Security Blue Team](https://www.securityblue.team/)
- [Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC)](https://www.giac.org/)
- [EC Council](https://www.eccouncil.org/)
- [SANS](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-training-overview/?msc=main-nav) offers a range of certifications but extremely pricey and not for beginners.
- [ICS2](https://www.isc2.org) has a free course called Certified in Cybersecurity which is for fundamentals **_[beginner friendly]_**, presumably to get new professionals in to their certification 'stream'. Higher level certifications are pricey and also require 5 years experience so not for beginners.
- [ISACA](https://www.isaca.org/)

## Vendor-specific

I've been warned about vendor certifications and training because you may get 'locked' in to using a specific type of product.

If you decide to get vendor training, try to remember the principles, rather than memorising the product itself. This way you can apply your knowledge across multiple platforms.

- Microsoft
- Splunk
- RedHat
- CISCO

# Degree or Postgraduate Studies

These are very formal and tend to take a more generalised approach to learning and does not provide detailed technical, practical knowledge.

**_Pros_**

- This may also get you access to LinkedIn Learning resources.
- You can also get discounts to TryHackMe.
- Get access to discounted memberships for professional bodies.
- You can access work placements and graduate programs.
- Many online options available.
- Looks good on a job application because it demonstrates tenacity; you can finish what you started.

**_Cons_**

- Expensive, especially if you are an international student.
- Generalised studies focused on theory - if you want practical hands on knowledge, then this option is not for you.
- They can take a long time to complete.

# TAFE

These courses offer more technical, practical and hands on learning. If you want to enter a more technical stream (i.e. red or blue team), then these courses may be for you.

**_Pros_**

- This may also get you access to LinkedIn Learning resources.
- Offered through many institutions, but TAFE is the main course provider (Government-subsidised for domestic students) and at the time of writing this, offer fee free courses.
- Look for your local provider.

**_Cons_**

- Not subsidised for international students.
- Can only access your state-local TAFE for fee free options which may not have the same resources or course set up as other states.
- Doesn't always offer access to graduate programs, as they mainly look for degree-level or higher.

# Other training resources and programs

- LinkedIn Learning is a good resource if you have a premium account or can access through university.

# Australian Conferences and Events

International conferences may be difficult due to time zones so haven't been included, but there are some amazing talks and seminars out there so don't discount them.

Attending conferences and events are a daunting prospect - one that I am working on myself! But apparently it is great for networking so... get yourself out there.

- [Australian Cyber Conference](https://www.cyberconference.com.au/)
- [SecTalks](https://www.sectalks.org/) have talks and meetup events in each state
- **Bsides** is a hacker convention that provides a community driven framework for information security conferences. There are a number of local chapters that hold events. Simply google `bsides` and your `city` to see if there is one near you.
- Google cybersecurity conferences and events for your local city.

# Talks, Videos, Podcasts and Articles

My favourites:

- Defcon is hacker-focused with lots of interesting talks - freely available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/defconconference).
- The [NDC Conference](https://ndcconferences.com/) is not cybersecurity focused, but their talks can be interesting! They do have conferences in Australia occasionally, but tickets are extremely pricey. They post many of their talks and seminars on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@NDC) - check them out!
- [BlackHat](https://www.blackhat.com/) is a nother hacker resource with talks available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/BlackHatOfficialYT).

# Interesting people

I follow these people, or at least try to find talks that they've done. They provide really good stories and insights, and make cybersecurity (more) interesting!

- **Brian Krebs** has infiltrated hacker forums and been the subject of some wild stories. Follow him on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bkrebs/) or visit his [site](https://krebsonsecurity.com/).
- **Graham Cluley** has some great anecdotes and his [podcast](https://www.smashingsecurity.com/) is always entertaining. You can follow him on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grahamcluley/) or subscribe to his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc5jsl5zRbbGbXO0AB4aW4w).
- **James Mickens** is a a Harvard Professor and his talks are always good for a laugh. My favourite is <em>"My Code Does Not Work Because I Am A Victim Of Complex Societal Factors"</em>, which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nj9ZjwOdFQ&ab_channel=NDCConferences).
- **Jayson E. Street** is a security consultant who has some great talks about some of his work. My favourite is <em>"Steal Everything, Kill Everyone, Cause Total Financial Ruin"</em>, which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsVtHqICeKE). He has some powerful messages about empowering employees for security. You can follow his [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jstreet/), or go to his [site](https://jaysonestreet.com/).
- **Cooper Quintin** has a great talk about <em>"Tracking the Worlds Dumbest Cyber-Mercenaries"</em>, which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zccAvgC4UxU&themeRefresh=1).
- **Zoz** likes to dabble in explosions... for computer science. My favourite talk is <em>"And That's How I Lost My Other Eye...Explorations in Data Destruction"</em>, which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bpX8YvNg6Y&t=21s&ab_channel=DEFCONConference).
- **Mudge** has a couple of nice ancedotes about his associations with Julian Assange and Anonymous in his talk called <em>"Unexpected Stories From a Hacker Inside the Government"</em>, link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSR-b9yuTbM&ab_channel=DEFCONConference).

# Practice and Play!

- Carry out some [projects](https://reconshell.com/100-red-team-projects-for-pentesters-and-network-managers/)!
- Use [samples](https://github.com/sbousseaden/EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES) to practice parsing event logs.
- [CTF Time](https://ctftime.org/) provides a list of international CTFs.
- The Australian Government provides [puzzles and challenges](https://www.asd.gov.au/careers/puzzles-and-challenges).
- Australian Signals Directorateâ€™s Australian Cyber Security Centre provides a simulated [cyber incident challenge](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/news/asdacsc-cyber-security-challenge).
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) has many learning pathways, many of which are free to use and are great for newbies. There is a premium option which gives you access to more content. They also have a yearly Advent of Cyber event where you can win prizes. They also have their own virtual learning environment, so spinning up your own VM is not necessary.
- [LetsDefend](letsdefend.io) provides hands on blue team training. I would also follow their [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/letsdefend/), because they post a lot of good resources and cheatsheets.
- [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/) also has regular CTF events. It doesn't hold your hand at all, so I would say that it's not so great for the newbies.
- [DownunderCTF](https://downunderctf.com/) is an Australian CTF. I think they're held annually so keep an eye out! You can find past challenges and solutions on their [GitHub](https://github.com/DownUnderCTF) if you want to practice. You can follow them on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ductf/?originalSubdomain=au).
- [SANS Holiday Hack Challenge](https://www.sans.org/mlp/holiday-hack-challenge-2023/?utm_medium=Referral&utm_source=SANS&utm_content=Vanity%20URL%20-%20%20holidayhack&utm_campaign=Holiday%20Hack%20Challenge%202023) is an international yearly event which all cyber professionals will be aware of! This is probably a bit more advanced, but still fun to have a go. You can access [past challenges](https://www.holidayhackchallenge.com/past-challenges/) for practice and find write ups to learn from.
- [Bandit wargame](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) is aimed at absolute beginners claiming to teach the basics needed to be able to play other CTFs.
