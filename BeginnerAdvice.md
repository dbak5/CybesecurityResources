# Introduction

<em>Disclaimer: general advice from anecdotes gathered from professionals across the industry. Please consider your own situation and make judgments as to whether the following advice applies to you.</em>

I wanted to put something together that is fairly general but comprehensive to provide a direction for newbies - because when I started, it was so hard to figure out where to begin. Thank goodness for mentors!

The contents of this specific page is information I wish I had known sooner, and therefore want to share with others so you don't make the same bad decisions I did - ha!

The following are important considerations when you're starting out.

**_Happy job hunting!_**

## Why cybersecurity?

This is the first question you should ask yourself, and potential employers will likely ask also.

**_What motivates you? What do you like? What are your strengths?_**

For me, the answer is obvious. I'm tired of my data getting breached. It's been normalised and it feels like there is no recourse for us as individuals. So making a positive contribution where I can is important to me.

Additionally, I love puzzles and to analyse data; delving deep, looking for insights and solving problems. The feeling when I find something new and create solutions is amazing! The bonus is, I'm good at it, and it's super easy to enjoy something you're good at!

Finally, there's always something new to learn. There are always new technologies, attacks and challenges that come them!

## Figure out what you want to do

There are many different types of roles in cybersecurity, with so much to learn about each. At first, I had no idea what I wanted to do, and was learning everything I could. There are only so many hours in the day; you can't learn it all and also learn it well.

Therefore, it is easier to find what kind of role you want, and focus on learning the things you need to for that role. If you want to do Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC), learn about the frameworks and regulation. If you want to do red teaming, learn about penetration testing etc.

If you aren't sure, do your research, talk to people in these areas. Ask them questions like what their day looks like, what sorts of things they do. These questions helped me to understand what these roles meant and decide if they were for me. Which is why networking is so vital.

Finally, do some practice exercises and find examples to see if you like it (this is the fun part).

### General Overview of Cybersecurity Roles

In simple terms, **_Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC)_**, is where the policy and compliance is done. Therefore, regulation and frameworks are super important. You can read the proper NIST definition [here](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/governance_risk_and_compliance).

**_Red Team_** are an organisation's internal group of hackers who try to attack the organisation's defenses, while the **_blue team_** will try to defend against the attack. There may be a **_purple team_**, which is a red abd blue team that work in unison. Read more about it [here](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/red-team-vs-blue-team/).

Generally speaking, **digital forensics** is a term used for roles that analyse and gather evidence for various reporting and potentially, litigation. You can read the proper NIST definition [here](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/digital_forensics#:~:text=NIST%20SP%20800%2D86%20under,be%20used%20in%20judicial%20proceedings).

## Networking

This is probably the most important part of trying to get into cyber. Having a network can help you find a job, understand the different roles there are, give key insights into the industry and provide you with support and some new friends!

I am an introvert and networking can be nightmarish - the thought of attending a 'networking event' gives me loads of anxiety! Therefore, one-on-one chats are probably the way to go if you're also an introvert.

Here's what I did:

- Find a mentor (or several)
- Arrange to chat with people over coffee, ask them questions about what they do
- Join networking groups and professional bodies - they usually have a mentorship program. If you're a student you can get a discount on fees
- Connect with professionals on LinkedIn and start a conversation or go for coffee
- Remember that others are probably feeling the same way you are, if you end up at a networking event, perhaps look for another terrified, quiet person

All the cybersecurity professionals I've met so far have been keen to share their experiences and offer advice. Don't be afraid to reach out.

## Learn to Communicate

I noticed that there seems to be a focus on writing and communicating to non-technical audiences. Therefore, it is probably valuable to learn and practice how to write and communicate professionally to others. Oftentimes, cybersecurity professionals will need to write briefings to all kinds of stakeholders, and therefore it is important that you can write a brief, tailored to diverse audiences.

Here's what I did:

- practice writing cover letters
- write assignments and put effort into writing them clearly and in non-technical language (unless otherwise requested) with proper grammar and spelling
- when doing projects and self study, practice writing out a walkthrough or a report on the new knowledge. This will also solidify it
- avoid using AI to write everything for you - it's tempting but I found it often misses key points or is outright wrong. If you must use it, make sure you read what it has written and then try to reword it

## Practice and Showcase

Practicing the skills you've learnt is important, and if you can demonstrate it, even better! This seems to be as (if not more) important as having formal education or training.

Here's what I did:

- investigated technologies and practised using them
- used GitHub to publicly share projects
- shared ideas and lessons learnt on LinkedIn
- write ups and walkthroughs of hackathons / capture the flag events
- set up my own workspace for carrying out practical tasks on a virtual machine (VM) using Kali Linux OS

**_A bit more on VMs..._**

<em>You should understand and learn how to set up your own VM; this is how we are able to safely analyse potentially compromised environments. You can find a guide [here](https://github.com/dbak5/CyberSecurityGuides/blob/main/VirtualMachineSetUp.md)</em>.

## Professional Bodies

Make sure you join professional bodies for resources and networking and training opportunities, including mentorship programs. Local ones are best if you want access to local events and training. Refer to the Professional Networking Bodies Page for further detail.

## Education and Training

There a many free or subsidised training programs out there. If you are just starting out, then look for these first.

While it's not always compulsory to have tertiary studies, it can certainly help. It is important, however, to factor in a number of things when choosing between the two if you don't want to waste time and money.

Refer here for my [list](https://github.com/dbak5/CybesecurityResources/blob/main/2CertificationsTrainingDevelopment.md) but bear in mind that this is not exhaustive!

### Certifications

Certifications can be expensive so you need to consider if they are necessary.

Anecdotally, I've heard they're not the most important aspect of gaining a job - employers want to see evidence of your skills in the form of practical examples and experience.

Furthermore, the certifications you need may depend on the role you want, and therefore, be cautious before diving into a specific certification.

If you gain a role, then your employer may pay for you to get certifications. Paying for it yourself beforehand doesn't make economical sense.

### Degree and Postgraduate Studies

For pros and cons, refer [here](https://github.com/dbak5/CybesecurityResources/blob/main/2CertificationsTrainingDevelopment.md).

The main ones are (ranked from lowest to highest level):

- Bachelor Degree (3-6 years average)
- Graduate Certificate (1-2 years average). Courses can count toward a masters
- Masters (1-2 years average). Courses can count toward a PhD
- PhD (3 years average)

### TAFE Courses

For pros and cons, refer [here](https://github.com/dbak5/CybesecurityResources/blob/main/2CertificationsTrainingDevelopment.md).

The main ones are (ranked from lowest to highest level):

- Certificate III in Cybersecurity
- Certificate IV in Cybersecurity
- Diploma in Cybersecurity

These can take 1-3 years, depending on a number of factors (part time, full time etc). The Certificate IV is the most popular and will more likely land you a job than a Certificate III. A Diploma is more advanced and will take longer to complete, but some units may count toward a degree.

### Keep up to date

Cybersecurity is constantly evolving, you need to keep on top of the latest updates, news and technology through continuous and motivated self-study. If this is does not sound like you, then I have some bad news; cybersecurity is not for you.

## Getting a Job

This has been the hardest part and these are my findings so far.

Firstly, due to most of Australian Federal Government Bodies residing in Canberra, there are many, many opportunities there. If you're willing to move to and live in Canberra - perhaps consider this.

I found that there are minimal entry level roles available, and it is disappointing that there are not more programs like the CyberCX Academy. Purportedly, there is a shortage in cyber skills, yet few organisations appear to be investing in future generations of cyber professionals. This makes entry level roles highly competitive, therefore you will need to really stand out on your job application.

### Australian Security Clearances

You may need a clearance to work in some roles, and these are only open to passport holders. There are different levels of clearance, refer to the [website](https://www.agsva.gov.au/) for more info.

### Recruiters

You may opt to find a recruiter. I have not had much luck in this space, but worth giving it a go. I have not done much research on it yet, but perhaps if I get more desperate, I'll add some suggestions here.

### Practice and Demonstrate

There has been a lot of mention about practice - I want to emphasis it further. Without practice and demonstration, potential employers aren't going to know your skills.

**_So practice, practice, practice._**

### Entry pathways

Many professionals I spoke with started out in a different area to cyber (e.g. helpdesk or finance), then pivoted into cyber from within the same organisation. This may be a good entry point, because you can leverage the reputation you have built with stakeholders and clients.

There are also entry level programs, such as the CyberCX Academy which I mentioned previously, and graduate programs available to students completing a degree or higher (some, but not many, will accept TAFE qualifications).

Some organisations will ask TAFE teachers to recommend their top students. Therefore, if you're doing TAFE courses, perform your best, try to stand out, and it could result in a recommendation.

And finally, the most obvious is the old help desk / IT support. I've been hesitant to do this and it's not because I'm not willing to do that type of work, but most people know that it is not the most rewarding and, to me, it really feels like a drastic step backward from my previous career. I will try other avenues first, but I'm not discounting it completely.

### Career Changers

There are many career changers in cybersecurity. Many cybersecurity organisations actively seek employees of diverse backgrounds because it fosters good decision making and the ability to understand diverse viewpoints (particularly helpful if you want to understand an adversary).

**_So don't think that you don't have skills to bring to the table. You are not starting from square one._**

### Gender Diversity

Women are still a minority, although that is slowly changing. Many organisations have managed to find a balance in gender diversity, however I have heard stories of 'being the only woman in the room'.

Many organisations are still working on gender diversity which means good news for women! They are highly sought after!

### Neurodiversity

Anecdotally, I've found that there are many neurodiverse individuals in the industry - which is amazing! The work seems well suited to the neurodiverse mind.

My thoughts (are generalised and obviously do not apply to everyone):

- can analyse and hyperfocus
- can provide innovative insights
- like to investigate and delve deep into data
- like to get technical
- can work from home well and can work independently

### Major hiring companies of interest

The main companies found during my research are:

- The major banks - always seeking pentesters (no surprises there)
- CyberCX - have the CyberCX Academy, but this is very competitive. I've heard that CyberCX have a great and supportive culture for newbies though, so worth trying
- DxC Technologies - apparently have a neurodiversity program but I haven't been able to figure out when it opens or how to apply
- Australian Signals Directorate / Defence - have regular graduate programs, but can be difficult to navigate the recruitment process
- Crowdstrike - remote first culture - no good if you prefer to be in the office. They also do not offer a lot of 'entry level' roles
- The Big 4 Accounting Firms
- Paraflare

If you feel that you are just waving about in the breeze (applying for roles), one piece of advice I was given is to focus on a couple of companies you are interested in, network with people from within the organisation and ask questions, i.e. how you can stand out in an application.
