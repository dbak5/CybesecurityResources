# Professional Bodies

Joining a professional body has many benefits. You can gain access to resources, programs, training, events and networking - however it does come with a fee. \
\
If you're hesitant consider:

- It looks good on your LinkedIn or CV
- Students can normally get a discount
- Your professional network plays a key role in gaining a job

This is, by no means, an exhaustive list. You should research your own and join the ones that seem right for you. \
\
However, I would recommend that you join local, Australian professional bodies, so that you can gain access to a network of local professionals and opportunities. \
\
These are only the ones I've joined.

## Australian Computer Society (ACS)

ACS is not focused on cybersecurity, but can provide some good learning resources. \

## Australian Information Security Association (AISA)

AISA has provided me with some good networking opportunities and have local chapters. \

## International

You can gain access to some great international resources through: \

https://www.isc2.org

# Networking Groups

Again, these can provide you with a great network, events and programs.

## Second Thursday of the Month Club (STOTM)

As the name states, these are held every Thursday of every month. Search for your local on LinkedIn, as they post event details and ticket links on their page.

## Women in Technology WA

This is WA specific and for women only, but just an example of a good networking association that you may join.

## Australian Women in Security Network

This is my favourite network association and have provided many opportunities - but yes, for women only.
